# PurplProto/AOC

I decided to start doing AOC in 2023. I don't have any real goals yet other than solving some puzzles. Some people use it to start learning a new language, which I can see myself doing in the future. But as of now, I thought I'd just familarise myself with the sort of puzzles it as since I've never tried AOC puzzles before, despite knowing of it's existence for a few years now.

Lets have some fun! ðŸ™‚

## Repo

I've mostly made this repo so I can look back on my solutions. Currently this is an [Nx](https://nx.dev/) monorepo using TypeScript which is what I use most. This may change in the future, or even this month if I decide to try a different language!
